# Welcome

Greetings, and welcome to my homesite. This site was created to allow me to reach out to everyone and have a more substantial online presence. In essence, I intend on using this site as a professional portfolio, and a professional blog site on my activates. I plan on performing some updates to the site so stay tuned for additional content, such as other projects I worked on or am currently working on.

If you are interested in getting in touch, please visit the [Contact page](../../contact) for my contact methods, I prefer to be contacted initially via email.

Have a great day!
